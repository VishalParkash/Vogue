path-breaking, award-winning playwright, Eve Ensler, comes a compelling memoir titled&nbsp;<em>No Apology</em>. Ensler spent a childhood being sexually abused and physically humiliated by her father, Arthur Ensler, while her mother watched on with a cold detachment. Ensler, who was never apologised to by her father for the years of trauma he put her through, sees&nbsp;<em>The Apology</em>&nbsp;as a harsh narrative that leads the way to a sense of healing. The Apology is written from the perspective of her sadistic father, who perpetrated a myriad of violations against her. The words she\'s has written are words that she\'s longed to hear from her father.&nbsp;<em>The Apology</em>&nbsp;also, in Ensler\'s view, sets an example and creates a manuscript of an apology for men.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Mumbai helps</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She mentioned, that while growing up, she had this fantasy that her father will wake up, come to his senses and render her an apology last Wednesday, as Akshara Centre, One Billion Rising and Avid Learning held a book reading and discussion at the Royal Opera House, Mumbai, in an ambitious effort to shine a light upon the rising violence against women in the country (a Reuters report, in 2018, named India as one the most dangerous country for women—one rife with sexual violence).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>The Apology</em>&nbsp;is much more than that, however. The abuse Ensler was subjected is the most common form of abuse for a woman. This memoir bares the genesis Ensler’s ground-breaking episodic play,&nbsp;<em>The Vagina Monologues</em>.

Even the most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/sensitive-skin-buying-new-makeup-tips\">sensitive skins</a>&nbsp;can find one that works for them,” says Isaacs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s an array of different types of vitamin A on the market – both prescription and over-the-counter—and there are also different percentages available, which means choosing the right produce can be confusing even for a seasoned skincare aficionado. Retinoids come with a flaky, sensitive skin warning tag and it can be tricky to find formulas the skin can tolerate, but the main thing to know is that retinol is one of the most scientifically-tested forms—and offers solid results. Retinaldehyde, meanwhile, is less common but “really well studied and you get amazing results from it”. All forms work to do the same thing—stimulate cell growth—but some are stronger than others, meaning the speed at which they work varies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“When it comes to a straightforward retinol, I would recommend that people should start on a 0.2 per cent or 0.3 per cent, and then build up to one per cent when starting out,” says Isaacs. “Whichever you choose, I recommend phasing the product slowly into your routine, especially if you haven’t used it before—twice a week for the first two weeks, then every other day for the following fortnight.” After a month, try using it nightly. Don’t expect to see instant results overnight, either. Our skin cells need time to understand the message they’re being given and then to implement their extra workload, so it can take up to six months to notice a real difference.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Phasing it into your routine can help to avoid any sensitive skin flare-ups, but there may still be some, which is why the winter months are the best time to introduce a retinoid to your skincare routine – you are less exposed to sunlight, and retinoids can thin our skin’s uppermost barrier. On that note, Isaacs points out: “Almost all forms of Vitamin A break down in sunlight, so never use it in the morning—it becomes ineffective. Even if you wear a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/best-budget-sunscreens-under-rs-1000-sun-protection-skin-care-products\">sunscreen</a>&nbsp;it degrades significantly, so use it only at night.” And that brings us to the cardinal rule of any skincare routine. In the words of Baz Luhrmann: “Wear sunscreen.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here’s&nbsp;<em>Vogue\'s</em>&nbsp;pick of the latest retinoids to try now:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Medik8 Crystal Retinal</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->','Now might be a good time to include retinol in your night-time skincare routine','','inherit','closed','closed','','138-revision-v1','','','2019-11-26 08:54:17','2019-11-26 08:54:17','',138,'http://dev.evantiv.com/vogue_wp/2019/11/26/138-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(142,1,'2019-11-26 08:56:58','2019-11-26 08:56:58','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/the-6-winter-boot-trends-to-wear-now\">Winter</a>&nbsp;is almost here, so it’s inevitable that we need to update our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/topics/skin-care/\">skincare regimen</a>&nbsp;as we do with our wardrobes—layering is just as applicable in beauty as it is with clothing.

Your face can easily become dehydrated because of central heating, and foaming cleansers can be a little stripping in terms of your skin’s top layer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>New York-based facialist Cynthia Rivas suggests: “Replace the habit of cleansing morning and night to just a nice splash of water over the face in the morning [and keep the regular cleanser at night]. Of course, this depends on the skin, but if you feel dry, a creamier, milkier cleanser is ideal.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An oil cleanser works best—the kind that turns into a milky fluid when you add water, as this clears away&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/topics/face-makeup/\">makeup</a>&nbsp;and debris much better than its gel counterpart. “Oil produced during the day is most effectively removed by oil,” adds Rivas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;recommends:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eve Lom Cleanser: A cult, deeply hydrating aromatherapy oil-based balm</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Éminence Stone Crop Cleansing Oil: A non-greasy cleansing oil, rich with hydrating jojoba</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>2.

It’s hot, we sweat, and the skin has a tendency to get congested, so many people build exfoliation into their daily routine. But in winter, it’s just as needed — so try not to pass over this important step.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“You should reduce the exfoliation a bit in winter, [as] you don’t want to overdo it when the skin is sensitive, so cut it down to once or twice a week,” says Rivas. “This gets rid of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/how-to/content/how-to-use-a-face-scrub-without-damaging-your-skin\">dead skin cells</a>, and means your products actually penetrate the pores.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One surprising, natural ingredient to look out for in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/best-budget-friendly-face-scrubs-to-add-to-your-skin-care-routine\">exfoliators</a>&nbsp;is rice.

Continue to use broad-spectrum protection, such as creams with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/sunscreen-know-how-right-sunscreen-your-skin\">SPF</a>&nbsp;of at least 30, as the UVB rays can still penetrate the skin’s dermal layers and cause damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, weaker UVB rays during the colder months mean it’s the perfect time to try certain skin treatments as they can actually work more effectively. “Working on pigmentation is better during autumn and winter [such as micro-needling or peels],” says Rivas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She adds: “My clients are not only exposed to fewer rays, which they need to avoid post-treatment as [the skin’s]&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/how-to-choose-the-right-sunscreen-spf-decoded\">protective</a>&nbsp;layers are removed or compromised during treatment, but [my patients] want the effects of treatment for the [festive] period.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;recommends:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>SkinCeuticals Advanced Pigment Corrector: A daily, brightening formula that fades pigmentation patches</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr Dennis Gross Clinical Grade IPL Dark Spot Correcting Serum: Uses clinical strength L-ascorbic acid, lactic acid and kojic acid to fade discolouration and spots</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>4.

Colder temperatures mean more exposure to the epidermis-drying effects of central heating, not to mention harsh skin-chapping winds and oil-clogged pores due to a lack of exfoliation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From switching up your cleanser to checking in on your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/ask-an-expert-what-is-skin-pigmentation-and-how-to-reduce-it\">pigmentation</a>,&nbsp;<em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;takes you through five ways to refresh your skincare routine for winter (and make sure your skin is protected well into those summer months that seem so far away).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>1. Switch up your cleanser</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s no surprise that your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/best-cleansers-for-oily-acne-prone-skin-you-can-buy-for-under-rs-500\">cleansers</a>&nbsp;need to be swapped out as the weather becomes drier and more hostile. Your face can easily become dehydrated because of central heating, and foaming cleansers can be a little stripping in terms of your skin’s top layer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>New York-based facialist Cynthia Rivas suggests: “Replace the habit of cleansing morning and night to just a nice splash of water over the face in the morning [and keep the regular cleanser at night]. Of course, this depends on the skin, but if you feel dry, a creamier, milkier cleanser is ideal.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An oil cleanser works best—the kind that turns into a milky fluid when you add water, as this clears away&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/topics/face-makeup/\">makeup</a>&nbsp;and debris much better than its gel counterpart. “Oil produced during the day is most effectively removed by oil,” adds Rivas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;recommends:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eve Lom Cleanser: A cult, deeply hydrating aromatherapy oil-based balm</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Éminence Stone Crop Cleansing Oil: A non-greasy cleansing oil, rich with hydrating jojoba</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>2.

It’s hot, we sweat, and the skin has a tendency to get congested, so many people build exfoliation into their daily routine. But in winter, it’s just as needed — so try not to pass over this important step.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“You should reduce the exfoliation a bit in winter, [as] you don’t want to overdo it when the skin is sensitive, so cut it down to once or twice a week,” says Rivas. “This gets rid of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/how-to/content/how-to-use-a-face-scrub-without-damaging-your-skin\">dead skin cells</a>, and means your products actually penetrate the pores.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One surprising, natural ingredient to look out for in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/best-budget-friendly-face-scrubs-to-add-to-your-skin-care-routine\">exfoliators</a>&nbsp;is rice.

Continue to use broad-spectrum protection, such as creams with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/sunscreen-know-how-right-sunscreen-your-skin\">SPF</a>&nbsp;of at least 30, as the UVB rays can still penetrate the skin’s dermal layers and cause damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, weaker UVB rays during the colder months mean it’s the perfect time to try certain skin treatments as they can actually work more effectively. “Working on pigmentation is better during autumn and winter [such as micro-needling or peels],” says Rivas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She adds: “My clients are not only exposed to fewer rays, which they need to avoid post-treatment as [the skin’s]&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/how-to-choose-the-right-sunscreen-spf-decoded\">protective</a>&nbsp;layers are removed or compromised during treatment, but [my patients] want the effects of treatment for the [festive] period.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;recommends:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>SkinCeuticals Advanced Pigment Corrector: A daily, brightening formula that fades pigmentation patches</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr Dennis Gross Clinical Grade IPL Dark Spot Correcting Serum: Uses clinical strength L-ascorbic acid, lactic acid and kojic acid to fade discolouration and spots</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>4. Mask all the time</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Skin is thirsty, dehydrated and irritated in the winter because the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/9-skincare-hair-makeup-tips-for-humid-weather\">humidity</a>&nbsp;levels outside drop, so the water in the air (and in your epidermis) evaporate more quickly. This means it’s harder for nutrients to penetrate the skin, making it tight, dry, and flakey—which nobody wants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“I always encourage a mask after exfoliation,” explains Rivas. “You’re going to get better penetration. Masks with more hyaluronic acid and antioxidants are best. You can’t over-mask.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Active,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/natural-skin-care-ingredients-to-soothe-and-heal-skin-in-summer\">natural ingredients</a>&nbsp;can be better for sensitive skin, or if you’re looking to avoid using too many chemicals on your face.

If there’s one thing you need to change about your routine when going from summer to winter, it’s mixing up your moisturisers and adding some variation based on what your skin is calling out for. Some feel that even the richest of creams don’t give them the moisture they need, while others say their skin can become oily and prone to spots when they use products that are too heavy. The key is to listening to your skin and switching it up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“[Incorporating] hydrating serums into your morning and evening routine is very effective,” says Rivas. “I especially like hyaluronic acid.

The penalty for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/pore-minimising-makeup-and-skincare-products-that-really-work\">clogged pores</a>&nbsp;ranges from blackheads to untimely acne breakouts, but recurring blockages could be a harbinger of congested skin. What exactly does it mean and how do you find your way out of this skincare landmine? It\'s too easy to go with your first instinct—to go exfoliation-crazy and try to slough off all bumps while cleansing enough times to totally strip the skin of oil. It might work in the short term, but the lack of oil and the over-exfoliation will likely cause the skin to fight back—leaving you stuck with more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/skin-care-tips-why-lipids-fats-are-important-for-glowing-skin\">breakouts and redness</a>&nbsp;than you had in the first place. We got celebrity dermatologist Dr Jamuna Pai and Hinaa Khan, education head at Dermalogica India, to detail everything you need to do for returning balance to congested skin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What is congested skin?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr Pai says, “Congested skin is characterised by its appearance which is rough in texture and has multiple open pores and comedones. The latter is caused due to dead skin cell buildup and related debris, further compounded by the lack of easy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/skin-care-technology-lymphatic-drainage-massage-for-bloating-and-more\">lymphatic drainage</a>.” Khan further elaborates, “Congested skin isn\'t just one thing; it’s the summation of a lot of things. If your skin is congested, you might notice bumpiness underneath the skin,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/skin-care-tips-have-recurring-acne-breakouts-on-your-forehead-or-jawline-this-could-be-why\">blackheads, small whiteheads</a>, breakouts and a general dull appearance.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What are the causes and symptoms of congested skin?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“This skin condition can occur due to overactive sebaceous glands, triggered by hormonal fluctuations, an unhealthy diet, the lack of a regular skincare routine, using incorrect skincare products and so on. Congested skin feels bumpy to touch and has prominent whiteheads and blackheads, especially on the cheeks and the T-zone,” recommends the Mumbai-based dermatologist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Khan explains, “Tackling skin congestion can feel like a never-ending process; you might try things that your friend swears by, but don’t quite work for you. But if you follow the basics of adequate cleansing, exfoliation and hydration, you\'ll be on your way to glowy skin again. In order to return balance to your skin, it’s important to get to the root of the problem, which means clearing out your clogged pores. The best way to clean the surface of your skin is a strict cleansing routine, regular exfoliation with hydroxy acids and using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/skin-care-products-best-day-creams-for-oily-skin-under-rs-500\">non-comedogenic skincare products</a>.

The star has been experimenting with a slew of ethnic outfits ever since, including lehengas and sharara sets, but the latest silhouette to win her favour has been the timeless sari. In recent times, Kapoor has turned to iterations of the six yard staple on multiple occasions, wearing everything to breezy floral saris to classic silk numbers with equal ease. She particularly loves to drape her mom’s old saris, like the the ivory and pink brocade number she wore to the 65th National Film Awards in 2018—her late mother, Sridevi, wore it for actor Ram Charan’s wedding back in 2012.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether she is attending an event or a wedding soiree, saris in bold colours have won Kapoor’s vote many times. While attending the 2019 edition of the Dadasaheb Phalke Awards in Mumbai, she opted for a red custom-made sari by Manish Malhotra. Her trick to elevate a non-embellished drape? Accessorising it with a halter neck blouse and a two-tiered silver necklace by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.in/content/amrapali-jewels\">Amrapali Jewels</a>. She wore a similar sari in yellow for Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s reception as well, amping it up with yet another styling hack. This time, she kept all the focus on her embellished blouse by draping the pallu like a dupatta from the back. We also saw her in a cobalt blue sari, worn with a matching sleeveless blouse, statement jhumkas and bedazzled juttis.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the years, Janhvi Kapoor has experimented with all versions of the traditional drape, from chiffon saris to classic silk numbers. She paired a gold and pink Manish Malhotra sari with a contrasting mint green and gold blouse for a special dinner hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind in 2018, and was spotted in a lightweight chiffon white sari by the same designer just last month. Floral saris are another favourite with the star. Cases in point: that peach Anita Dongre sari she was seen in earlier this year, which came covered with yellow blooms; and her ivory Tarun Tahiliani drape, featuring a pretty floral border in shades of maroon, purple and green and worn with a strappy floral blouse.

She particularly loves to drape her mom’s old saris, like the the ivory and pink brocade number she wore to the 65th National Film Awards in 2018—her late mother, Sridevi, wore it for actor Ram Charan’s wedding back in 2012.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether she is attending an event or a wedding soiree, saris in bold colours have won Kapoor’s vote many times.

Floral saris are another favourite with the star. Cases in point: that peach Anita Dongre sari she was seen in earlier this year, which came covered with yellow blooms; and her ivory Tarun Tahiliani drape, featuring a pretty floral border in shades of maroon, purple and green and worn with a strappy floral blouse.
